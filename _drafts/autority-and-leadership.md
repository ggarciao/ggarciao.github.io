excerpt: You need the authority to make a decision and the leadership to make it last

Nowadays, everything must be done as soon as possible, everyone must be fast. This pace push people to make *quick decisions*. To gets things done, people also needs *strong decisions* reached by consensus, because if an idea is shared by a group it will be promoted by that group. 

But *quick decisions* are usually weak because they are 'imposed' by someone with **authority**, whereas *strong decisions* are usually slow because they need to be 'embraced' by severals (usually thanks to someone with **leadership**).

## As fast as an Dictator

A dictator make *quick decisions* that not needs to be strong because they are imposed purely by **authority**. Nobody can argue that things will change fast, but a lot of things will not get done because people does not agree. More quick but not strong decisions are made, more work will be unfinished, leading to the inexorable destiny of all dictatorship ... the fall.

But here is something that I want to stress: **Dictators fails due to *quick but not strong decisions* and the authority has nothing to do with this failure**. I'm saying this because people have the tendency to mix it all: Someone is not 'bad' because it has the authority but due to the weak decisions he made with it.  

That being said, lets take a look to the good part about this system: **authority allows *quick decisions***. This is very important because **authority** is not bad but necesary in modern enterprises to keep the pace: managers, team leaders, everyone needs some level of authority to make *quick decisions* to go foward faster.
