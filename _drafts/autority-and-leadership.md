excerpt: You need the authority to make a decision and the leadership to make it last
---

Nowadays, everything must be done as soon as possible, everyone must be fast. This pace push people to make *quick decisions*. To gets things done, people also needs *strong decisions* reached by consensus, because if an idea is shared by a group it will be promoted by that group. 

But *quick decisions* are usually weak because they are 'imposed' by someone with **authority**, whereas *strong decisions* are usually slow because they need to be 'embraced' by severals (usually thanks to someone with **leadership**).

## As fast as a Dictator

A dictator make *quick decisions* that does not requires to be strong because they can be imposed purely by **authority**. Nobody can argue that things will change fast, but a lot of 'small' things will not get done because people will lack of motivation (or worse!). More quick but not strong decisions are made, more work will be unfinished, leading to the inexorable destiny of all dictatorship ... the fall.

But here is something that I want to stress: **Dictators fails due to *quick but not strong decisions* and the authority has nothing to do with this failure**. If you are able to decide that does not means that you will fail, right? What might make you fail is to constantly decice on behalf of others without their concord.

**Be able to decide, this is what *authority* is all about**. People with **authority** gets things done because they can decide to do this instead of that, and viceversa. And this is a good thing ... if the people that cannot decide agreeds.

## As strong as an Activist Leader

Activism is based in consensus encouraged by a leader(s).
