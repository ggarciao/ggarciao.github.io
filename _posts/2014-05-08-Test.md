Its very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com).

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

And here is a image

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use  one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway


There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

{% highlight javascript %}
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
{% endhighlight %}

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

{% highlight javascript %}
// Here we register a controller. As you can see, we are injecting the
// 'messageService' that will be created by the factory
main.controller('MessageRendererCtrl', ['$scope', 'messageService',
  
  // This function will be called by angular when initializing the
  // controller (is like the servlet init method)
  function($scope, messageService) {
 
     // Like in java, components comunicates through scopes 
     // (like page, session and context scopes in java)
 
     // We initialize the message 'DTO'
    $scope.messageDTO = messageService.read();
 
    // Here we are defining a method that the view can call
    // to interact with the controller (usually after an interaction with the user)
    // This is like the doGet/doPost/... that allow the user to change the view
    $scope.updateMessage = function(newMessage) {
    	
    	// We invoke the service to modify its state
    	messageService.update(newMessage);
    	
    	// We update the message 'DTO' to update the template
    	// This will be done automatically by angular thanks to its
    	// bindind feature
    	$scope.messageDTO = messageService.read();
    };
 
  }
]);
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
public class Test {

  private static final String MESSAGE = "Hello World";

  public static final main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Message: " + MESSAGE);
    return;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
